Inspired by React MUI theming solution in order to implement something like that for Angular projects.

Still this solution is universal and framework agnostic so could be used wherever.

## Supported versions

Version | Supported
------- | -----
  1.x   | :white_check_mark:
  0.x   | :x:


## Important

- [x] Since 1.0.0 whole lib is separated into 3 packages. [See changelog](https://github.com/mopcweb/jss-theme/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [x] Since 0.5.3 is bundled in not minified version because in Angular it causes problem with decorators usage.
In future minor releases this package will leave only generic code and all specific (for example Angular decorators and Class) will be removed into separate one
